                    <h2>Mach 1 </h2><br>
                    <p>The Ford Mustang Mach 1 is a 
                      performance-oriented option package[1]
                      of the Ford Mustang muscle car, 
                      originally introduced in August 1968 
                      for the 1969 model year. It was 
                      available until 1978, returned briefly 
                      in 2003, 2004, and most recently 2021.
                      As part of a Ford heritage program, 
                      the Mach 1 package returned in 2003 
                      as a high-performance version of the
                      New Edge platform. Visual connections 
                      to the 1969 model were integrated into
                      the design to pay homage to the original. 
                      This generation of the Mach 1 was 
                      discontinued after the 2004 model year,
                      with the introduction of the fifth 
                      generation Mustang.</p><br>
